AI WhatsApp Assistant 🤖 live: https://marika-ganczarczyk-ai.netlify.app/

A React-based chat application that mimics WhatsApp's interface, enhanced with an AI assistant that provides automatic conversation summaries.
📋 Overview
This project improves the existing AI WhatsApp Assistant by adding a key feature: automatic conversation summary generation. At the end of each chat session, the AI creates a concise summary containing the essential information (date, time, meeting purpose) and sends it directly to employers or calendar managers. This eliminates the need to read through entire conversations.
